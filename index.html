I'm Dong, an MSc student studying Ocean and Climate Physics at the University of Hamburg. I am interested in **Ocean Modeling** , **Data Assimilation**, and **Machine Learning**.

I am currently working on my MSc thesis on Ocean Adjoint Modeling under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ifm.uni-hamburg.de/en/institute/staff/stammer.html"> Prof. Dr. Detlef Stammer </a> and <a href="https://www.ifm.uni-hamburg.de/en/institute/staff/koehl.html"> Dr. Armin Köhl </a>.

I started studying Oceanography in China, where I gained an overview of ocean and climate science. My bachelor thesis was about **coastline evolution analysis using Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems**. Then I continued an academic path during the time of the pandemic, I was enrolled in a master’s program in Ocean and Climate Physics at the University of Hamburg, Germany, where I deepened my knowledge in physical oceanography and climate science and focused my expertise on modeling. One year later, I moved to Utrecht, Netherlands, where I enhanced my skills in ocean-climate modeling and data analysis. Now I am near the end of my master’s program, working on my master thesis on **sea-level variability under a strong warming scenario, with a focus on the Southern Ocean, using the Adjoint Method**.
