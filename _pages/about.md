I study Physical Oceanography, interested in **Ocean Modeling**, **Data Assimilation**, and **Machine Learning**.


I worked on large-scale circulation using the adjoint technique, as my Master's thesis, at the University of Hamburg.

I am currently working on mechanisms of Red Sea Deep Water formation events, as a visiting student (Dec 2022- Jun 2023), at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology.


**Meanwhile, I am looking for a Ph.D. position starting around fall 2023.**

<!--I started studying Oceanography in China, where I gained an overview of ocean and climate science. My bachelor thesis was about **coastline evolution analysis using Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems**. Then I continued an academic path during the time of the pandemic, I was enrolled in a master’s program in Ocean and Climate Physics at the University of Hamburg, Germany, where I deepened my knowledge in physical oceanography and climate science and focused my expertise on modeling. One year later, I moved to Utrecht, Netherlands, where I enhanced my skills in ocean-climate modeling and data analysis. Now I am near the end of my master’s program, working on my master thesis on **sea-level variability under a strong warming scenario, with a focus on the Southern Ocean, using the Adjoint Method**.-->
